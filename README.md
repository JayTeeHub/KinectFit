# KinectFit
KinectFit incorporates a Xbox Kinect (Gen. 1), a MySQL Database and a .NET GUI that provides people with the ability to find their size for their faviourite clothing brands. The user selects their desired brand and type of clothing they're looking for like a dress shirt, jeans, dress, skirt, etc...The Kinect then uses the MySQL Database to determine which body parts need to be measured, based on the input provided by the user. Once the Kinect is done it sends the measurements to the database which returns the size that is displayed to the user.

In sumamry that is what the KinectFit does my goal with this project was to develop a way to stream line the customers experince they're trying to find their size for their faviourite brands without having to try on multiple sizes. 

This project is a prototype at best and was developed in 3 weeks for my final project in my Computer Engineering Technology program here in Toronto, Canada. I've been sitting on this project since Dec. 2014 with the mindset to do something with it but since then i've started my own company and don't have the time to develope this so I want to throw this out the world and see what they can do. In the coming week I hope to have a video up showing a demo of the project so that everyone can get a better understanding of what it is and what it does.

I'll have more technical details regarding the project in the coming week. I know the Xbox Kinect use to have a fairly large open data community (maybe it stil does) so i'd love to see what someone could do with this idea.
